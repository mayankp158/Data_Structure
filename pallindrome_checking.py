'''A palindrome is a word that is the reverse of itselfâ€”that is, it is the same word when read forwards and backwards.

For example:

"madam" is a palindrome
"abba" is a palindrome
"cat" is not
"a" is a trivial case of a palindrome
The goal of this exercise is to use recursion to write a function is_palindrome that takes a string as input and checks whether that string is a palindrome. (Note that this problem can also be solved with a non-recursive solution, but that's not the point of this exercise.)'''

    """
    Return True if input is palindrome, False otherwise.
